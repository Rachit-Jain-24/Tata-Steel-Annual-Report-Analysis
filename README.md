Annual Report Analysis Dashboard using Streamlit

This project provides an interactive web application built with Streamlit for performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis on annual reports. The primary example used is the "Tata Steel Annual Report 2023-24," but the application also allows users to upload their own PDF files for analysis.

üìã Features

This dashboard takes a PDF as input and provides a multi-tab interface with the following analyses:

Sentiment Analysis:

Calculates the overall sentiment of the document.

Displays metrics for the number of positive, neutral, and negative sentences.

Visualizes the distribution of sentiment polarity with a histogram.

Word Frequency & Cloud:

Identifies and displays the top 20 most frequent words in the report.

Generates an interactive word cloud for a quick visual summary of key terms.

Topic Modeling:

Uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover underlying topics in the document.

Allows the user to interactively select the number of topics to model.

Dual PDF Source:

Option to analyze the pre-loaded "Tata Steel Annual Report".

A file uploader to analyze any other PDF document.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
